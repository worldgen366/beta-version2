After, he enrolled at The Queen’s College, Oxford, and graduated in 1976 with a B.A. degree in physics. <br> Upon graduation, Berners-Lee worked at Plessy Company, a telecommunications firm in Dorset. By 1978, he helped D.G. Nash in creating typesetting software for printers. <br> In 1990, he married Nancy Carlson, with whom he had two children.

<p> Later in 1980, while at CERN, he facilitated a program for sharing and updating information using hypertext. Initially, his prototype was called Enquire and aimed to connect researchers and projects around the world. Berners-Lee thought that a database where researchers from different places can share information would save energy, time and money. <br> By 1989, he began working on his information sharing system through an application protocol called HTTP. This Hypertext Transfer Protocol became the venue to transfer and share information over the Internet using an address known as URL or Uniform Resource Locator. <br> Technically, Berners-Lee created a web of servers connecting all computers around the world. In addition, he also developed the first browser and first web server. <br> He started talking with computer enthusiasts as his work at CERN became recognized.He began developing web browser software for computers like Mac and PC. Since then, other enthusiasts continued to develop his idea of information sharing. <br> In 1994, he formed W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. W3C is a consortium known as World Wide Web Consortium that was meant to improve the web. <br> Berners-Lee assured that the web is a royalty-free technology that anyone could adopt easily.</p>
